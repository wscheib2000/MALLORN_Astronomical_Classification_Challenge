# MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge

Join the hunt for stars being torn apart by black holes!

The 10-Year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) using the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will soon begin. It is expected to revolutionise time-domain astronomy, discovering 100x more astronomical transients (such as supernovae) than we’ve ever discovered.

With this wealth of new data will come an inherent challenge, as we do not have the available resources to classify all of the objects that we discover. In astronomy, classifications are generally performed by using a spectroscopic instrument on a telescope to get a spectra from an object, showing you the intensity of the light with respect to wavelength and allowing you to identify emission or absorption features that tell you more about the object you’re observing. LSST will require us to be able to identify which objects are likely interesting based purely on their lightcurves (change in brightness over time) in order to choose which to devote our limited follow-up resources to.

In particular, we’re interested in a class of objects called tidal disruption events (TDEs). These occur whenever an unlucky star is ripped apart by the immense gravitational forces it experiences as it approaches too close to a supermassive black hole. TDEs are a relatively recent astronomical discovery with a very small catalogue of observed objects (~100). However, those that we have found have proven to be tremendously scientifically valuable, particularly for investigating the properties and feeding conditions of otherwise very difficult to observe black holes. Our research capabilities are currently limited by our small sample size, but LSST provides the opportunity to solve that issue – provided we are able to make the best use of it. For more information on tidal disruption events see here(1)(2).

To help meet this challenge, we introduce the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) Classifier Challenge. This competition invites participants to help us prepare for LSST by developing machine learning algorithms capable of photometrically identifying TDEs within a simulated LSST dataset. The light curves in this challenge are simulations based on real observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).

Google Colab notebooks are available describing how to use the data and the methods used to generate the data.

The paper describing the production of the data set and the structure of the data challenge is now submitted to arXiv and has been submitted for publication
